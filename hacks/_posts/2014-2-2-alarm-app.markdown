Description
------------

Our hack is an Android app which basically works as an Alarm Clock. 

Besides having the regularfeature of setting the alarm at a particular time, it also can set the a relative alarm i.e. the alarm will go off after the required amount of time. 

Our app also has a very basic user interfaceand hence setting up an alarm is very quick. 

Future Prospects
-----------------

We also had intended to introduce meeting mode in which we can set the time of the day when we  want to automatically turn the phone to Vibrate only mode.

Also it can take the schedule of various appointments from the calendar app and set the mode accordingly.

There can also be a option to set Vibrate mode when a relative alarm is set, hence ensuring no phone calls disturb the user's sleep. 

Also the user can set a particular message which is read aloud when the alarm goes off, using text-to-speech feature for ex. "Wake up, its time for our quiz" etc.
