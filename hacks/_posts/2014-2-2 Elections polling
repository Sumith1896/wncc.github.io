We have made a Election Poll System for IIT Bombay Elections. Keeping in mind the upcoming elections and some of the functionalities which are missing in present portal we have tried to improve it.
In this Polling System

Objective
This polling system provides the platform for IIT Bombay students to communicate among themselves. Contestants can go forth and campaign their motivation and visions. On the other hand voters can discuss their Expectations, Problems, Grievances through this online system. Thus we want to reduce communication gap between voters and contestants so that election system can become more transparent and efficient.

Functionalities
Contestant
1. New Contestant can register himself or herself and choose the post for which he or she wants to apply.
2. Contestant is asked his motivation for applying and his vision

Voters
1. Voters can up vote or down vote the contestants depending upon which contestant among all they like the most.


Constraints
1. One contestant can register only once for a position.
2. Voters cannot vote for the same contestant more than once.

Future Work
1. Voters can comment regarding their problems, expectations and grievances which can also be up voted and down voted.
2. We may use it in next coming elections.
