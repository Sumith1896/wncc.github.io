Bootstrap was one of the biggest innovations in the web development space in this decade. Bootstrap is a rock solid framework that helps you build responsive websites with ease.

Many websites are built using bootstrap but even today majority of websites are built using custom css. Only later they realise - Hey! we need a responsive website. Our app Bs2Bs helps convert custom hacked website into bootstrap framework.

Bootstrap is built using LESS. Modifying bootstrap to match site styles involves infering a set of variables regarding the site like body-background,etc. Once these variables are infered from site, it is easy to translate the website using [Webbify framework](http://webbify.in). We use a number of heuristics to infer boostrap settings from the site and later generate a bootstrap css themed using site styles.

Currently Supported:
-------------------

1. Navbar Styles
2. Scaffolding settings
3. Footer Settings

To Do:
------

1. Infering custom styles on components like Carousel
2. Handling extras like custom hover effects which cannot be directly done using bootstrap
