This is an IITB Moodle Sync app.

All you have to do is enter your LDAP ID and password and choose the course you want and the app will download all the material that you haven't already downloaded.

You can choose to make the app run in the background every hour/day/week (works only with Linux), or you can manually login and choose what to download (works with any OS)

Features :
---------

1. Completely GUI
2. The option to save your login details and settings
3. Gives notifications when a file is downloaded in the background

Future Plans:
------------

1. Integration with ASC. 
2. Support for newsforum posts.
